### About The Project
Mikro is the final year project of my bachelors degree. <br/>
Mikro is an online shop builder and manager system. <br/>
This project consists of three big parts: 
- a react web application (online shop)
- a react native mobile application (online shop manager)
- a node backend server application (RESTful API)
### How does Mikro work?
1. Business owners will start by building their online shop using the Mikro mobile application. 
2. Once the online shop is deployed, a link to the website will be provided.
3. Customers can now make purchases through the online shop.
4. Sales can then be managed by the business owner in the same Mikro mobile application.
